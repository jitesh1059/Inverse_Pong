# Inverse_Pong
This is the classic version of Pong, but with a minor twist.

## Description about the game
This game has a feature where the player controls two sides of the paddle and tries to avoid the ball from getting out of the play area.
As points increase, difficulties increase too. The game will have modes like paddles getting closer to each other and some other new things.
